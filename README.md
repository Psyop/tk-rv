## Documentation
This repository includes the RV engine for Shotgun's Toolkit framework.

In order to have the engine start you must be running RV 6.2 at minimum.
Place the shotgun_toolkit-0.1.0.rvpkg file located in the startup folder in
a path that is included in the RV_SUPPORT_PATH environment variable.  Once
the package is installed and loaded the RV engine should start.
